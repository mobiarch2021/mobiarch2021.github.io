                    <h2>Welcome</h2>
                    <p>The program committee is delighted to invite you to the 16th Workshop on Mobility in the
                        Evolving Internet Architecture MobiArch 2021. The workshop will be held <b> online (virtual workshop) </b> on
                 October 25, 2021. MobiArch is in conjunction with <a
                            href="https://www.sigmobile.org/mobicom/2021/index.html">MobiCom 2021</a></p>
                    <h2>Aim and Scope</h2>
                    <p>The last two decades have witnessed an extremely fast evolution of network technologies and an
                        unprecedented growth in mobile data traffic. According to Cisco Annual Internet Report, over 70
                        percent of the global population will have mobile connectivity by 2023 and machine to machine
                        (M2M) connections will be half of the global connected devices and connections. This trend is
                        coming along with increased capabilities and intelligence of devices, hence offering great
                        opportunities for research innovation and development.</p>
                    <p>Globally, 5G network deployment is rapidly moving from trials to early commercialisation and is
                        promising to provide higher data speeds at low latency and enhanced throughput to handle more
                        simultaneous connections without causing disruptions. However, some issues and challenges have
                        not been fully addressed in 5G mobile networks and they are attracting further research efforts.
                        Among these issues, we mention the emerging applications challenges that are pushing the
                        required quality of service QoS to extreme levels, the mobile edge computing issues for user
                        mobility support in small cells, the tendency towards Open and smart RAN enabling interoperable
                        interfaces and RAN virtualization that are pushing embedded machine learning systems and
                        artificial intelligence back end modules for an enhanced RAN intelligence.</p>
                    <p>Furthermore, given the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak, the (wireless & wired) broadband Internet and
                        mobility become more than a desired feature but now a mandate, from home office, online
                        education and e-business to gaming and VR/AR/360-degree video for tourists and entertainment; as
                        well as various outdoor activities... Hence, supporting the quality of experience QoE for users
                        and business interactions becomes more critical for Internet-based infrastructure.</p>
                    <p>All these challenges drive the need towards deep research on next generation mobile Internet
                        system that tackles these issues while delivering new mobile services and defining the
                        fundamental architectural components for the next generation mobile Internet.</p>
                    <p><b>MobiArch'21 workshop will focus on the technical architecture issues for next generation
                            mobile Internet, to tackle the aforementioned challenges.</b> MobiArch 2021 welcomes
                        submissions from both researchers and practitioners from academia and industry that explore the
                        latest developments in mobile communication technologies and architectures. In addition, we
                        encourage work-in-progress and position papers that describe highly original ideas, present new
                        directions, or have the potential to generate insightful provocative discussion at the
                        workshop....</p>
