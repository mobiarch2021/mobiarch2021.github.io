              <td width="66%"><p class="text-justify"> Mobility support is a prominent utility service provided by cellular networks to mobile Internet. As the only large-scale wireless network with seamless wide-area mobility support, 5G/4G and its predecessor networks ensure always-connected experience for billions of mobile phones and tens of billions of things no matter where they are and where they go.  

 

In this talk, I would like to talk about technical challenges and progresses for 5G and beyond mobility. With advanced wireless techniques (e.g., wider spectrum, massive MIMO, small cells) and increasing demands (e.g., extreme mobility, 3D coverage, ultra-high availability), 5G mobility faces with not only new problems in emerging scenarios but also old problems which are deteriorated with the mitigation from 4G to 5G. I will first present our recent efforts to reveal and characterize the negative impacts of legacy mechanisms and policies for mobility support, and then discuss potential solutions and ongoing efforts in the community. There is no end for mobile network evolution, which pushes us to even revisit the fundamental limit of next-generation mobility support.   <br>

This talk will present an overall vision for a 6G system to be realized towards the end of this decade. The drivers, use cases and technological enablers for 6G will be discussed with the goal of mapping the journey to a richly connected, intelligent system that will further integrate computing and communications, both wireline and wireless, and become an indispensable foundation for society. </p></td>
