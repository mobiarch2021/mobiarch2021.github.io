              <td width="66%"><p>Our vision is a world where limitless connectivity improves lives, redefines business, and pioneers a sustainable future. Since the completion of the first 5G specifications in 2018, there has been a substantial expansion of commercial 5G deployments happening throughout the world, with networks providing new communication capabilities and services set to transform society. Undoubtedly, the ongoing transformation will eventually give rise to challenges beyond what 5G can meet. In 2030, for instance, society will have been shaped by 5G for ten years, and new needs and services will have appeared. This calls for continued evolution towards limitless connectivity — following the pull from society’s requirements and the push from more advanced technological tools becoming available — that must be addressed for a 6G era around 2030. This talk will discuss the journey towards limitless connectivity from 5G evolution to 6G. <br>
