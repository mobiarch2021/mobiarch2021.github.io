Since the completion of the first 5G specifications in 2018, there has been a substantial expansion of commercial 5G deployments happening throughout the world, with networks providing new communication capabilities and services set to transform society. Undoubtedly, the ongoing transformation will eventually give rise to challenges beyond what 5G can meet. In 2030, for instance, society will have been shaped by 5G for ten years, and new needs and services will have appeared. This calls for continued evolution towards limitless connectivity — following the pull from society’s requirements and the push from more advanced technological tools becoming available — that must be addressed for a 6G era around 2030. This talk will discuss the journey towards limitless connectivity from 5G evolution to 6G. <br>

              <td width="66%"><p class="text-justify"> Mobility support is a prominent utility service provided by cellular networks to mobile Internet. As the only large-scale wireless network with seamless wide-area mobility support, 5G/4G and its predecessor networks ensure always-connected experience for billions of mobile phones and tens of billions of things no matter where they are and where they go.  

 

In this talk, I would like to talk about technical challenges and progresses for 5G and beyond mobility. With advanced wireless techniques (e.g., wider spectrum, massive MIMO, small cells) and increasing demands (e.g., extreme mobility, 3D coverage, ultra-high availability), 5G mobility faces with not only new problems in emerging scenarios but also old problems which are deteriorated with the mitigation from 4G to 5G. I will first present our recent efforts to reveal and characterize the negative impacts of legacy mechanisms and policies for mobility support, and then discuss potential solutions and ongoing efforts in the community. There is no end for mobile network evolution, which pushes us to even revisit the fundamental limit of next-generation mobility support.   <br>
